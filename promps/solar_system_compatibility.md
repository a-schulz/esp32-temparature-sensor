The current temperature sensor ds18b20 should be installed into a heating system. Wifi is present everywhere. 

The goal is to be able to view the current temperature on mobile phones etc. 

I also have more esp32's and also a raspberry pi. There is a sma solar system working which is currently controlling fritz smart outlets to controll a electrical heating if the battery is full and much energy is produced by the solar panels. This might be automated with something else. Recommend a better infrastructure it should be maintainable
